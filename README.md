## Overview
This repository contains an AI-powered agent designed to automate B2B receivables collection. The goal is to reduce late payments, improve cash flow management, and minimize manual intervention in the collections process. By analyzing payment behavior, leveraging machine learning, and using intelligent reminders, the agent can anticipate and address potential payment delays.

## Features

1. **AI-Driven Payment Reminders**  
   Intelligent reminders based on payment behavior analytics.

2. **Automated Invoice Processing**  
   OCR and NLP-based invoice extraction and validation to reduce manual data entry and errors.

3. **Risk Scoring & Prediction**  
   Machine learning models predict late or non-payments, enabling proactive follow-up.

4. **Auto-Reconciliation**  
   Smart matching of incoming payments with corresponding invoices to reduce reconciliation errors.

5. **Payment Scheduling & Execution**  
   Timed collection processes to ensure timely follow-up and a more predictable cash flow.

6. **Multi-Channel Integration**  
   Support for emails, SMS, and API-based payment gateways for flexible, omni-channel communication.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI / Flask)
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow / PyTorch, scikit-learn
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- **Frontend (Optional)**: React / Vue.js
- **Cloud Deployment**: AWS / Azure / GCP

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/b2b-receivables-collection-agent.git
    cd b2b-receivables-collection-agent
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:  
   Create a `.env` file in the project root or configure environment variables directly in your hosting environment. For example:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase
    OCR_API_KEY=your-ocr-api-key
    ML_MODEL_PATH=./models/payment_risk_model.pkl
    ```

5. **Run Database Migrations (If Required)**:
    ```bash
    # Example using Alembic (for SQL)
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

6. **Start the Server**:
    ```bash
    # If using FastAPI:
    uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

    # If using Flask:
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Invoice Upload**  
   Upload invoice files (PDF or images) via a POST request to `/invoices/upload`. The OCR and NLP modules extract relevant details such as invoice number, amount, and due date.

2. **Payment Reminders**  
   The agent automatically triggers reminders based on due dates, payment history, or custom business rules. You can also schedule reminders via an API endpoint like `/reminders/schedule`.

3. **Risk Scoring & Predictions**  
   The ML model evaluates the likelihood of late payments. Query risk scores through an endpoint such as `/risk/score/<client_id>`.

4. **Auto-Reconciliation**  
   When payments are received, the agent matches them to outstanding invoices using intelligent entity matching. Any unresolvable discrepancies can be flagged for manual review.

5. **Monitoring & Dashboard** (Optional)  
   A frontend (React/Vue.js) can display an overview of pending invoices, risk scores, and upcoming payment reminders.
