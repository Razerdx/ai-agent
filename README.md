## Features
1. **AI-Driven Payment Reminders**  
   Automatically send tailored reminders based on historical payment behavior (e.g., frequent delays or partial payments).

2. **Automated Invoice Processing**  
   Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and NLP (Natural Language Processing) to extract and validate invoice data, minimizing manual data entry.

3. **Risk Scoring & Prediction**  
   Train a machine learning model to identify high-risk accounts that are more likely to miss or delay payments, enabling proactive intervention.

4. **Auto-Reconciliation**  
   Automate matching of incoming payments with corresponding invoices, using AI-based entity matching to minimize errors.

5. **Payment Scheduling & Execution**  
   Seamlessly integrate with payment gateways or banking APIs to handle collection scheduling and execution.
